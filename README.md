## 1. Introduction

The harmonic oscillator is a fundamental model in physics described by the differential equation:

\[
y'' + \omega^2 y = 0
\]

This project solves the harmonic oscillator equation using a quantum algorithm and compares the results against classical solutions. The main objectives include:

- Simulating the oscillator’s dynamics using a quantum circuit.
- Evaluating the system’s kinetic and potential energy over time.
- Optimizing the quantum circuit for efficiency.

## 2. Quantum Algorithm Framework

The quantum algorithm consists of three main stages:

1. **Encoding**: Preparing the initial quantum state based on the problem’s initial conditions.
2. **Entanglement and Dynamics**: Evolving the system through quantum gates to represent the dynamics of the oscillator.
3. **Decoding**: Reversing parts of the encoding process and extracting results via measurements.

### Key Features:
- **Ancilla Register**: Stores computational states.
- **Work Register**: Facilitates entanglement and measurement.

### 3.1 Comparison with Classical Solutions

The quantum algorithm successfully reproduced the solution:

\[
y(t) = \sin(t) + \cos(t) \quad \text{for the interval } t \in [0, 1]
\]

This matched classical results with high accuracy.

### 3.2 Energy Dynamics

- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: Simulated and matched the classical form:
  \[
  KE = 0.5 \times (\cos(t) - \sin(t))^2
  \]
- **Potential Energy (PE)**: Simulated and matched:
  \[
  PE = 0.5 \times \cos^2(t)
  \]

### 3.3 Parameter Range Observations

- Accuracy decreased slightly for extended simulation bounds, emphasizing the importance of parameter optimization for larger intervals.

## 4. Circuit Optimization

The circuit’s complexity grows with the number of qubits:

- **Gate Count**: Scales approximately as \(2n(n - 1)\), where \(n\) is the number of qubits.
- **Optimization**: Minimizing the circuit depth and adjusting parameters reduced computational costs while maintaining accuracy.
